#SQL Training Notes:

To get started, refer to the instructions in the [Repo's Read Me](https://github.com/akgilbert/training/blob/master/README.md)

This training was put together thanks to [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/6f2636/42) (free query runner) and [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) (free data randomization).

For additional SQL learning resources, I'd reocmmend the following:

* [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
* [w3 schools' query runner](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_op_in)
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions)
* [Google](https://www.google.com/doodles/world-cup-2014-14)
